# Sitemap Genrator

This is a React App. It will generate sitemap.xml for every url that is selected by the user. The user can add, edit, update and view the list of urls.

I also created an api for backend using PHP and MySQL which is a separate project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
